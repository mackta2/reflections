How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allowed to quickly see the differences between the two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   I can view the previous changes in files and make better programs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It will allow me to remember my changes so that i can view the history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Better edit trail for tracking purposes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git Log - gives a history of the committs
Git Diff - Compares two committs and shows the additions (green) and deletions (red)


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Allows more experimentation

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Edit files on the fly.
