What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you create a place for the meta data and all associated files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to place the files that you have made logical changes.  It provides a holding place for files before you make a commit.
